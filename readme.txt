# Functional imaging through scattering medium via fluorescence speckle demixing and localization

Codes for the results shown in: Functional imaging through scattering medium via fluorescence speckle demixing and localization. 

Data files in https://figshare.com/s/6e03c52b7aaefc6afd0a (too big for github)

Parameters for the two datasets (corresponding to Fig.3 and Fig.5 of the manuscript):
parafilm:
binning = 2
numbeads = 19
frame_size = (720,800)

brain_slice:
binning = 2
numbeads = 11
frame_size = (890,940)

stronger binnings can be performed (3, 4, etc.), 
increasing speed at the cost of
lowering localization precision
